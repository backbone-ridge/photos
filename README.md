# Photos
Modern-day photos of historical locations.

Here is a demo of how to upload a photo to this repository.  (Note that you must be granted "write" permissions in order to do this.)

UPDATE NEEDED!

# Filenames

* To save server space, photos should be not more than 1000px on the shorter side.
* The photo filenames should not contain spaces.
* For consistency, filenames should be all lowercase.
* Photos should be stored in the appropriate town folder.

The filenames should be unique within a town.  Although it should work fine to keep the filename saved by the camera, it may be helpful to rename the file to indication the lot number and corner (or side) where the photo was taken.  If multiple photos are taken from the same location, just add a word to make each name unique.  For example:

```
47sw.jpg
47sw-car.jpg
47sw-winter.jpg
```

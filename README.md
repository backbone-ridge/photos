# Photos

This repo contains photos to be included on the military-lots map.

In addition to the instructions below, here are a couple of demo videos:
- [Adding a photo](https://youtu.be/NpM8zNQva7k)
- [Deleting a photo](https://youtu.be/B2lOBSRf4JU)

Note that you must be granted permissions in order to add photos to this repository or update the spreadsheet.

## 1. Adjust the image size

- Photos should be not more than 1024px on the shorter side.
  (This will result in smaller files, and faster display on the website.)
- Be sure to reduce the size **BEFORE** uploading to GitHub.

## 2. Rename the image file

- Each town has a separate folder.
- Within each town, each image filename should be unique.
    - Usually the lot and corner will suffice.
    - Optionally, add a word or two to distinguish photos taken near the same location.
- Use hyphens, not spaces.
- For consistency, lowercase is preferred.
- Examples:
    - 53nw.jpg
    - 53nw-winter.jpg
    - 53nw-schoolhouse.jpg

## 3. Upload to GitHub

- Upload the image into the appropriate town folder.

## 4. Update the photo spreadsheet

- Go to the [Backbone Ridge photos spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ShUDiRpW_t_C6RUwkKxcUR4WKdkfWqF0mEbiWhCGDX0/edit?usp=sharing)
- Enter the photo info (town and filename) in a new row.
- To get the coordinates of a photo, click the location on the [Military Lots map](https://backbone-ridge.github.io/military-lots/)
    - The coordinates will be silently copied to the clipboard.
    - Paste (CTRL-V) into the longitude cell in the spreadsheet.
      (Both the longitude and latitude coordinates will be pasted)
- Add a brief title describing the photo.

## 5. Check the photos on the map
- Go to the [Military Lots map](https://backbone-ridge.github.io/military-lots/)
- Press CTRL-SHIFT-R to reload the page.
- The updated photo points should appear on the map.  Click a point to view the photo.

Further edits can be made to the spreadsheet as necessary.  Changes should appear almost immediately after reloading the map page.
